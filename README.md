# Churn_Risk_Model_Prediction

### Churn rate is a marketing metric that describes the number of customers who leave a business over a specific time period. 
### Every user is assigned a prediction value that estimates their state of churn at any given time. 
### It factors in our unique and proprietary predictions of how long a user will remain a customer. This score is updated every day for all users who have a minimum of one conversion. 
### The values assigned are between 1 and 5.
